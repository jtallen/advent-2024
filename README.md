## Advent of Code 2024

### Background

My brother sent me a link to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024) challenge for this year and I thought it could be fun to try solving the solutions using Python to help myself get a bit more comfortable with the syntax. The challenge so far hasn't been too difficult, but I've been busy with work and family stuff so I haven't been able to devote as much time to it as I'd like.

### My Approach

I'm going to try to catch up with the early challenges and then do one day per challenge from there and see how it goes. I'll focus on keeping my solutions performant and readable, while learning and implementing Python best practices.

### Days Completed
